Glowish Solver
==============
Glowish is a game made by [The One Pixel](https://theonepixel.com/). It works by flipping
the state of the tiles, until you have the entire board glowing. When you click a tile, it
and every tile with same color or same geometry flip their state, similar to the game
Lights Out.
